## Abstracst 
<!-- (50-60 words) --> todo mathujah 

## Research Questions
<!-- (50-60 words) --> got it
- How can the effectiveness of scare-off measures on wild boar be measured?  
- Which impact do hiking trails (disturbance element) have on the movement patterns of wild boars?  (Territory use / trail density) Influence with Parameters such as topology, land cover use, etc.) 

## Results / products
<!-- What do you expect, anticipate? --> todo mathujah

## Data
<!-- What data will you use? Will you require additional context data? Where do you get this data from? Do you already have all the data? --> got it, maybe more

## Analytical concepts
<!-- Which analytical concepts will you use? What conceptual movement spaces and respective modelling approaches of trajectories will you be using? What additional spatial analysis methods will you be using? --> 
Since the two questions are not related together, we are going to approach the two questions separately. The idea behind the first question is to compare similar but different approach, in order to determine the better way to measure the effectiveness of scare-off measures, from a statistical but also ecological perspective. Wild boars move through space following a typical limited 2D Euclidean space. 
To answer the second question, the idea is to study the influence that roads and trails (as an index of disturbance) have on wild boars. To do this, wild boar movements will have to be compared with simulated wild boar movements. In this way, it will be possible to determine whether the wild boars have become accustomed to the presence of humans. 

## R concepts
<!-- Which R concepts, functions, packages will you mainly use. What additional spatial analysis methods will you be using? -->
To import and to manipulate tabular data we use the libraries "readr" and "dplyr". ggplot2-package is used to plot data and sf-package to handle spatial vector data. Since we are working on time-data we also need the library "lubridate". Other packages will be loaded and used if needed. 

## Risk analysis
<!-- What could be the biggest challenges/problems you might face? What is your plan B? --> no risk no fun

## Questions? 
<!-- Which questions would you like to discuss at the coaching session? --> todo
- The analytical and R concept for both questions still has to be defined exactly, can you give us any tips?
